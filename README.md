# 🧮 Prime Number Checker

A simple Python utility to check whether a given number is a **prime number**.

> A **prime number** is a number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Implement a Python function `is_prime()` that determines whether the number passed into it is a **prime number** or not.  
The function should return `True` if it is a prime number and `False` otherwise.

---

## 🧠 Definition

- ✅ A **prime number** has exactly two distinct positive divisors: `1` and itself.
- ❌ `1` is **not** a prime number.
- ✅ `2` is a **prime number** (the only even one).
- ❌ Any number divisible by another number apart from `1` and itself is **not** prime.
